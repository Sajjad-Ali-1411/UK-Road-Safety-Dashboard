# UK-Road-Safety-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard analyzing UK road accident trends by vehicle type, road type, location, and light conditions — delivering insights and recommendations to improve road safety.

# 🚦 Road Accident Analysis (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **road accident data** using an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
The goal is to identify key accident trends, understand high-risk categories, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to improve **road safety** and reduce casualties.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall accident and casualty trends across years.  
- Identify **high-risk vehicles, road types, and locations**.  
- Compare **urban vs rural accident patterns**.  
- Assess accident impact by **light conditions and seasons**.  
- Recommend **policy and infrastructure improvements**.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** → Dashboard & visualization  
- **Excel/CSV** → Data source  
- **DAX** → Calculated measures (year-over-year changes, percentages)

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. **Total Casualties (195.7K)** and **Accidents (144.4K)** decreased by ~12% vs previous year.  
2. **Fatal Casualties (-33.3%)** show a strong decline, but slight/serious casualties remain high.  
3. **Cars (155.8K)** account for ~80% of casualties, followed by **two-wheelers (15K+)** and vans.  
4. **Single Carriageways (145K casualties)** are the most dangerous road type.  
5. **Urban areas (61.9%)** have more accidents than rural (38.1%), driven by higher traffic density.  
6. **Daylight (73.8%)** accidents dominate, showing traffic volume is a bigger factor than visibility.  
7. **Geographic hotspots** include London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds.  
8. **Seasonal spikes** in summer months (May–Sept).

## 📈 Recommendations
- 🚗 **Vehicle Safety Focus**: Enforce seatbelt/helmet laws, speed checks for cars & bikes.  
- 🛣️ **Road Infrastructure**: Improve **single carriageways** with lighting, dividers, and lane markings.  
- 🏙️ **Urban Road Safety**: More zebra crossings, bike lanes, and traffic calming in high-density cities.  
- ☀️ **Seasonal Campaigns**: Awareness drives before summer holidays to reduce spikes.  
- 🌃 **Darkness Safety**: Better street lighting, reflective gear for cyclists/pedestrians.  
- 🗺️ **Hotspot Monitoring**: Focus on **high-risk zones** identified in the heatmap.
